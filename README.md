## Emufront

A video game and computer emulator front end implemented with Qt and C++ originally for mobile Linux (Maemo and Meego) but as a Qt project should be usable on other platforms as well. This was originally hosted in Gitorious (https://gitorious.org/emufront/emufront.git/?p=emufront:emufront.git;a=summary) but decided to upload here for better home since gitorious is not active any more.
