# Some of my current hobby projects

## [Software Collection Manager](https://github.com/zorrokid/software_collection_manager)

This is continuation from my earlier experiments ([1](https://github.com/zorrokid/iced_game_collection), [2](https://github.com/zorrokid/mame-software-lists)) with Rust and Iced to build a software collection manager and emulator front end suitable for my personal purposes and hopefully also useful for someone else in the future.

## [el-man](https://github.com/zorrokid/el-man)

Automatically manage electric heating by hourly electricity prices. This has been controlling heating to our holiday home in the countryside for about a year now. Mostly based on cloud functions running in Goole Cloud developed with Python. Has also a simple React UI to manage settings for automation. 

## [Media Collector](https://github.com/zorrokid/MediaCollector)

Currently learning about Android app development with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose toolkit and by integrating to Google Firebase services. Implementing a media collection management app. Media can be DVD's, Blu-rays, VHS-tapes, CD-records, C-cassettes, vinyls, physical games of different formats etc. This will replace film_freak which I was developing earlier using Flutter.

# Some of my frozen hobby projects
## [Iced Game Collection](https://github.com/zorrokid/iced_game_collection)

My current most active hobby project I'm working on. A retro gaming collection management app and emulator front end for desktop usage. Developed with Rust and Iced.

## [MAME Software List Runner](https://github.com/zorrokid/mame-software-lists)

A front end for running software from MAME Software Lists with MAME and other emulators. This is my first effort with Rust and having a blast with it so far!

## Emufront

A video game and computer emulator front end implemented with Qt and C++ originally for mobile Linux (Maemo and Meego) but as a Qt project should be usable on other platforms as well. This was originally hosted in Gitorious (https://gitorious.org/emufront/emufront.git/?p=emufront:emufront.git;a=summary) but decided to upload here for better home since gitorious is not active any more.
