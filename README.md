- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zorrokid aka Mikko KeinÃ¤nen (https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikkokeinanen)
- ðŸ‘€ In addition to coding Iâ€™m interested in Linux, movies, retrogaming, photography
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter / Dart and refreshing my memory and skills with C++ and Qt

My interests and goals for near future are (the things that I'm curious about and want to experiment with when I have time from my current active hobby projects): 
- WASM in client and server (WASM micro sesrvices) with Rust (or C++ or Go)
- Bare metal coding with C / ASM on Raspberry Pi (I have Pi 3)  
- A small C++ game programming project (propbably with SDL, I'm more into the game engine side of things)

# Some of my hobby projects

## Emufront

A video game and computer emulator front end implemented with Qt and C++ originally for mobile Linux (Maemo and Meego) but as a Qt project should be usable on other platforms as well. This was originally hosted in Gitorious (https://gitorious.org/emufront/emufront.git/?p=emufront:emufront.git;a=summary) but decided to upload here for better home since gitorious is not active any more.

To my surprise the original site for app is still up: http://emufront.garage.maemo.org/
