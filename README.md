# Some of my hobby projects

## film_freak

Mobile app for movie collection management implemented with Flutter and Dart
- https://github.com/zorrokid/film-freak

## Emufront

An emulator front end for Nokia Maemo N900 mobile device implemented with Qt and C++ and therefore should be usable on other platforms as well. This was originally hosted in Gitorious (https://gitorious.org/emufront/emufront.git/?p=emufront:emufront.git;a=summary) but decided to upload here for better home since gitorious is not active any more.
