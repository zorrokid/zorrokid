- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zorrokid aka Mikko KeinÃ¤nen (https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikkokeinanen)
- ðŸ‘€ In addition to coding Iâ€™m interested in Linux, movies, retrogaming, photography
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter / Dart, Kotlin / Jetpack Compose for Android, Go, Node.js and refreshing my memory and skills with C++

# Some of my hobby projects

## film_freak

Mobile app for movie collection management implemented with Flutter and Dart
- https://github.com/zorrokid/film-freak

## Emufront

A video game and computer emulator front end implemented with Qt and C++ originally for mobile Linux (Maemo and Meego) but as a Qt project should be usable on other platforms as well. This was originally hosted in Gitorious (https://gitorious.org/emufront/emufront.git/?p=emufront:emufront.git;a=summary) but decided to upload here for better home since gitorious is not active any more.
